  In this first stage, the client wants you to design and implement UI/UX parts of the mall using HTML & CSS. To attract as many visitors as possible, the client wants the new website to support at least 3 types of device:

Desktop computer: 1024 pixels or higher width
Tablet: 768 to 1023 pixels width
Smartphone: 767 pixels or lower width
Here are some places where you may need to provide different UI component arrangements for different device types:

Navigation menu bar: always-visible horizontal navigation menu on desktop computers vs. alternating between visible and hidden vertical navigation menu on tablets/smartphones
Input form: a label and its linked input field may be positioned on the same line on desktop computers, but they should be placed on 2 different lines on tablets/smartphones
Layout: a multi-column layout on desktop computers may collapse into a one-column layout on tablets/smartphones

Display a contact form for visitors to contact the mall owner. The form contains the following fields

Contact purpose (a drop-down select element, use human-friendly text to display information, but use shorter computer-friendly values to store information; apply this principle for other inputs too)
Name: a required text field
Email: a valid email address
Phone: a valid phone number
Preferred contact method: 2 radios (email and phone)
Contact days: from Monday to Sunday (7 checkboxes)
Message: a multiple-line text input
Two buttons: Clear and Send
Use the same header and footer as the Mall Home page.

A README.md file is required in the root folder of your submission to describes briefly your group and the mall website. It also contains the GitHub URL of your repo. You need to add me as a collaborator to your repo. My GitHub ID is TriDang
