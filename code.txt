  In this first stage, the client wants you to design and implement UI/UX parts of the mall using HTML & CSS. To attract as many visitors as possible, the client wants the new website to support at least 3 types of device:

Desktop computer: 1024 pixels or higher width
Tablet: 768 to 1023 pixels width
Smartphone: 767 pixels or lower width
Here are some places where you may need to provide different UI component arrangements for different device types:

Navigation menu bar: always-visible horizontal navigation menu on desktop computers vs. alternating between visible and hidden vertical navigation menu on tablets/smartphones
Input form: a label and its linked input field may be positioned on the same line on desktop computers, but they should be placed on 2 different lines on tablets/smartphones
Layout: a multi-column layout on desktop computers may collapse into a one-column layout on tablets/smartphones
